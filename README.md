# Pauly Jump: Weaselwood Quest

Wheezin’ the juice, bu-ddy! Welcome to **Pauly Jump: Weaselwood Quest**, a radical platformer game where Pauly Shore, the ultimate Weasel, struts through **Weaselwood**—a totally gnarly, knockoff Hollywood filled with palm trees, shady agents, and bad vibes. Pauly’s on a mission to rescue the babes kidnapped by the gnarly caveman himself, **Encino Man**! But watch out—squares (like uptight studio execs) and authorities (Weaselwood’s coppers) are out to harsh Pauly’s mellow.

## Gameplay
- **Navigate Weaselwood**: Jump, run, and slide through neon-lit streets, sketchy back alleys, and tie-dye taco shops.
- **Avoid the Squares**: Dodge those lame studio suits and clipboard-wielding authorities trying to shut down Pauly’s party.
- **Power Up**: Grab **weed** to boost Pauly’s health (it’s medicinal, bu-ddy!) and hunt for **special bags** to score extra lives.
- **Rescue the Babes**: Save the babes trapped by Encino Man in his prehistoric penthouse at the end of Weaselwood Boulevard.
- **Pauly Vibes**: Rock pixel-art visuals, retro tunes, and Pauly’s classic “Wheezin’ the juice!” one-liners.

## Why It’s Awesome
Inspired by Pauly Shore’s legendary flicks like *Bio-Dome* and *Son in Law*, this game brings the 90s slacker spirit to your screen. It’s a love letter to Pauly’s wild energy, perfect for fans and newbies alike. Let’s get weaselin’!

## How to Play
